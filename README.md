RobotPy Eclipse Plugins
=======================

This is the source code for a set of experimental Eclipse plugins based on 
the WPILib Eclipse plugins. The goal is to tightly integrate RobotPy into
Eclipse using WPILib components and pydev.

This is still very much in development, please file any issues you might have
at https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-eclipse-plugins/issues

Requirements
============

* You should have python 3.4+ installed
* You should have the latest version of [pyfrc](http://pyfrc.readthedocs.org) installed
* You should have Eclipse 4.x installed
* Eclipse must be using Java 8+ (WPILib plugin requirement, sorry)


Installation
============

Use the Eclipse update manager to install the plugins from our download site. It can
usually be found at `Help -> Install New Software`. Once there, add a new plugin site
using the 'Add' button, and use this URL:

    http://dl.bintray.com/robotpy/eclipse/

If you did it right, it should show a few things, including 'PyDev' and 
'RobotPy Robot Development'. You should install the RobotPy plugins and also
the Pydev plugins.
